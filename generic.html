					It is my pleasure to be part of this event and take this opportunity to tell you the story of 3 Idiots. How it is created and came in to an existence. Every occasion will have its own history. The 3 Idiots is also not out of this, it is too have its own history. For this history, I am going back to Jan 2014. We had an exclusive discussion for bringing a new and different platform to bring students from different disciplines, join together, create an idea, and develop their idea to further levels until it becomes a solution or product to the society to address the real time problems. The seed has come from the minds of our respected principal Dr.N.Suresh Kumar; he has brought the word “3 IDIOTS” for us and made us to create the platform on “3 IDIOTS”. The word 3 IDIOTS is having its own meaning. The numeric 3 refers 3 students from 3 different departments, I refers –Idea, D refers Develop, I refers Implement, O refers –Optimize, T refers Test and S refers Sell. This platform will bring the 3 students from 3 different departments, join together develop a solution for any real time problems through well defined stages from Idea to Sell. They can bring their contributions in any of the above mentioned 6 levels and present and come out with fruitful outcomes for further levels. The event is mainly proposed to make the students to spend their winter / summer holidays in more positive and productive manner.</center></p>
